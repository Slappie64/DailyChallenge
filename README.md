# Daily Code Challenge

Welcome to my Daily Code Challenge! In this repository, I will be completing a coding challenge every day using Exercism. Exercism is a fantastic platform that provides a collection of coding exercises and mentorship to help you improve your coding skills in various programming languages, including Python.

## What is Exercism?

Exercism is an online learning platform that offers a wide range of coding exercises to help you become a better programmer. It provides a structured way to learn and practice programming in your chosen language. Each exercise comes with a description, a set of unit tests, and an interactive platform to submit your solutions. You'll receive feedback from experienced mentors to help you improve your code.

## How this Repository Works

In this repository, I will be:

1. **Completing Daily Challenges:** Every day, I will select a challenge from Exercism and attempt to solve it. The challenges cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, making it an excellent resource for coding enthusiasts of all levels.

2. **Documenting My Solutions:** I will document my thought process, approach, and the code I write to solve each challenge. You can find detailed explanations in the corresponding subdirectories.

3. **Sharing My Progress:** I will update this README regularly with links to each day's challenge and the corresponding solutions. This way, you can follow along with my progress and learn from my solutions.
